Tidal power is an emerging form of renewable energy that uses tidal forces to spin turbines, thereby generating energy. It is similar to hydrolelectric energy, but instead of harnessing the energy of a flowing river, it draws energy from tidal swells. 

It can have special applications for data centers, since it can be built in areas that otherwise wouldn't be desirable for development. Although there are not currently any data centers specifically using this form of energy, one is being planned for Scottland, and will utilize up to 80MW of tidally generated energy.

Iceland can be seen as the gold standard of countries embracing renewable energy. It is perfectly located to take advantage of geothermal energy and hydroelectric. Roughly 87% of electricity is generated by hydro-power, and geothermal covers the rest, in addition to providing almost 100% of heating energy. 

The enthusiastic embrace of renewable energy allows the country to put emphasis on developing new technologies and refining existing techniques.

In 2018, Visa suffered a large network outage. It was determined not to be a result of a cyber-attack, but rather a "hardware failure."

The outage lasted around 10 hours and affected an estimated 10% of transactions, with most problems ocurring while processing payments. This totalled of 5 million transaction. According to Charlotte Hogg, CEO of Visa's European operations, "A component in Visa's primary data centre 'suffered a very rare partial failure'".

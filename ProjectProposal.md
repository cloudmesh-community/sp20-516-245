# Cloudmesh-compute for Google

This project will focus on enhancing the capabilities of Cloudmesh-Compute by targeting Google API's directly, to replace the existing implementation. 

This project will involve setting up key handlers and security groups.  

Tasks in the project include:
    * Becoming familiar with the existing implementation
    * Learning about the Google API for Python and the commands that will be needed to natively interact with it
    * Replacing the existing Provider.py class with the new implementation
    * Creating benchmarks for Provider and ensuring code runs efficiently
    * Creating test cases to be confident that everything works

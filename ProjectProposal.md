# Cloudmesh Benchmarking

This project focuses on creating automated benchmarking for all current and future cloud providers, by utilizing the abstract provider class to ensure that functionality has been implemented, and to provide a benchmarking time comparison of the relative speeds to various cloud offerings. By running the exact same functions on each provider, a direct comparison can be made between them, and by automatically generating the tests, it will remain future proof against additional providers and functionality. 

Tasks in the project include:
    * Becoming familiar with the existing cloud providers
    * Updating documentation for registrations that are out of date or overly confusing
    * Using the Stopwatch/ Benchmark class to track the time each component takes
    * Using the base Provider class to compare all sub-classes
    * Saving data to a file in a readable format so that data can be easily compared
